Description:
============

This is an implementation of the Genetic Algorithm for solving the Master Mind 
game. 

It is based on this [Paper](https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/164803/1/kbi_0806.pdf)


The source code is configured for P=4 N=6 parameters with an average of 4 turns
to guess the color code for around 0.4 seconds. 




TODO:
=====

- Test check_play function
- Use eliteratio when making in the generation process
- Add CLI parameters for tweaking the algorithm
- Add GUI
- Use concurrency for generations
